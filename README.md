# What Makes a Song a Hit?  
**A Multi-Perspective Statistical Analysis Using Spotify Data (2000–2020)**

This project explores the audio and metadata characteristics that influence whether a song becomes a **Spotify hit**, using a full-stack data science approach:

> **Statistical testing → Causal inference → Bayesian estimation**  
> to rigorously answer: _“Does increasing danceability make a song more popular?”_

---

## Project Goals

- Identify which features correlate with hit potential
- Estimate the **causal effect** of danceability using Propensity Score Matching
- Quantify **uncertainty** using Bayesian A/B testing
- Develop a clean, dashboard-style visual summary of results

## 📊 Key Results

| Method | Insight |
|--------|--------|
| 🎯 **Danceability** | Strongest positive predictor of popularity |
| 🧪 **Hypothesis Test** | High danceability triples hit probability |
| 📈 **Regression** | Danceability has the highest standardized effect |
| 🧠 **Causal Inference** | +1.28 point ATE (matched analysis) |
| 📈 **Bayesian Inference** | 95% credible interval for hit lift: **[1.2%, 1.8%]** |
